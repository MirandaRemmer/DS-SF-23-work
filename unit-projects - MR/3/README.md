## DELIVERABLES

### Completed iPython Notebook

- **Requirements:**
  - Create dummy variables.
  - Calculate OR by hand.
  - Complete a logistic regression using stats models and interpret your findings.
  - Calculate predicted probabilities.

- **Bonus:**
  - Plot the predicted probabilities.
  - Brainstorm ways to improve your analysis.

## RESOURCES

### Dataset

The dataset is available [here](../dataset).

### Starter code

Review the questions in the [starter code notebook](./starter-code/unit-project-3-starter-code.ipynb) provided.

### Suggestions for Getting Started

- Review logistic regression, odds ratios and probabilities from prior lessons.
- **Read the docs for Stats models.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a data scientist!

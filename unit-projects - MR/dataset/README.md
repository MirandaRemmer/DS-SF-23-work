We'll be using for all Unit Projects (1-4) the same dataset as UCLA's Logit Regression in R tutorial to explore logistic regression in Python.  Our goal will be to identify the various factors that may influence admission into graduate school.

The dataset contains four variables: `admit`, `gre`, `gpa`, and `prestige`:
- `admit` is a binary variable.  It indicates whether or not a candidate was admitted into UCLA (`admit = 1`) our not (`admit = 0`).
- `gre` is the GRE score.  GRE stands for Graduate Record Examination.
- `gpa` stands for Grade Point Average.
- `prestige` is the prestige of an applicant alta mater, with 1 being the lowest (not prestigious) and 4 as the highest (high prestige).

Your project will be assessed using the following standards, as defined by the course syllabus and the data science workflow:

- **Identify & Acquire**

Requirements for these standards will be assessed using the scale below:

| Score | Expectations |
|:---:|---|
| **0** | _Incomplete_ |
| **1** | _Does not meet expectations_ |
| **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_ |
| **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_ |

Acceptable performance for this standard is based on how well you've applied specific learning goals within your deliverable.  To review the full list of data science standards, see the course syllabus.

While your total score may serve as a helpful gauge of whether you've met project goals, __specific standards scores are more important__ since they can show you where to focus your efforts in the future!
